-   Bring questions to your class, to office hours or a mentor session.
-   Be sure to follow **all instructions** as there are no resubmissions or regrades.

##### **Instructions:**

-   In Visual Studio Code, **write the code** that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
-   **Comment your code**, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
-   **Create a new repository on GitHub** for this week's assignments and **push your code** to the repository.
-   Record and Upload a **Video** showcasing your assignment.
-   Keep Track of the **URLs** for this week's GitHub repository and Video upload.
-   Start the **Quiz** to submit your assignment.
    -   Put the URL for your GitHub repo into the Quiz
    -   Put the URL for your Video into the Quiz

##### **Coding Steps:**

-   Style the website you made last week using **CSS** with the following requirements:
    -   Use only external CSS file (no internal or inline styling)
    -   Every element must be styled.
    -   Create style rules using **class**, **id**, and **element** selectors.

##### **Video Steps:**

-   Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
-   This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
-   This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
    -   You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
    -   This will create a video recording on your computer.
-   This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
    -   Ensure the link you share is **PUBLIC** or **UNLISTED**!
    -   If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.

##### **Submission Text Box Format:**

-   **GitHub Repository URL:** [_https://github.com/my_github_user_name/repository_name_here_](https://github.com)
  
-   **Video URL:** [_https://youtu.be/YNWjLha5x3o_](https://youtu.be/YNWjLha5x3o)
