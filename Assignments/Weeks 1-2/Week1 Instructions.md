##### **Coding Steps:**

-   Create a website using only HTML. The website can be anything you like (within school guidelines) if it meets the following criteria:
    -   At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page.
    -   2 different size headers, a list, 3 images, a table, and a form.

##### **Video Steps:**

-   Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
-   This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
-   This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
    -   You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
    -   This will create a video recording on your computer.
-   This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
    -   Ensure the link you share is **PUBLIC** or **UNLISTED**!
    -   If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
